# Object-Oriented-Programming
A repository.

My name is Juan Castillo, I go to Southwest Tech University, and I am in the Software Development Program.

This repository exists because it's a class assignment and that I need to get more used to GitHub as a whole. The only file it holds as I'm writing this is the "README.md" file.

A personal bio
> I enjoy writing, I write almost every day.
> 
> Going on hikes is one of my favorite activites, and I intend on doing them almost weekly now that winter is over.
> 
> Technology is one of my favorite things.
> 
> Watching long videos that go over certain topics, books, shows, etc is a great pass-time of mine.
> 
> I love music.

I am taking this program to up my knowledge on technology, software, and code. My end goal is to have a job that I can enjoy, remember, be appreciated for, and live properly through. This sort of career is highly important to me and I hope it goes well.
